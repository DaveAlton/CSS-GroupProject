    <p><strong>Fortune House Seafood Restaurant</strong> and its award-winning team of chefs, meets a standard 
       other Chinese restaurants try hard to achieve.</p>
    <p>The kitchen team is led by Executive Chef Tony Wu, a former winner of three gold medals 
       at the 2004 World Championship of Chinese Cuisine in Beijing, China. More than 300 chefs 
       from around the world took part. </p>  
    <p>His senior team members are also winners at the 2008 World Championship. 
       The Head Chef in charge of Cantonese-style cooking, Wing Ho, is the holder of a “Best of the Best” award.  
       He is the former head chef of the Ritz Carlton in Shanghai.</p>
    <p>The restaurant’s new look mixes western and oriental design, but the food is still spectacularly Chinese.
       From traditional favourites to unique dishes like stir-fried sliced ostrich meat, or beef tenderloin in
       sweet and sour sauce, the menu is extensive and comprehensive. Fortune House is also available for
       conferences and wedding banquets.</p>
