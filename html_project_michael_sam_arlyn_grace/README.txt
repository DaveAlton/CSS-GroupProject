Hey everyone. Create a stylesheet called YournameStyle.css
This will be a good way to have all of ours look the same. We'll need to use the same HTML, so whenever you want to view the page with your style, you'll just have to change the link to your stylesheet (ie. just change the name of the stylesheet).
