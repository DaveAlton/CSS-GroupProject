        <h2 id="review">Sam's Review</h2>
                <p>
                    I have taken my family to the aquarium several times. I have two kids, 3 years old and 8 months old. My wife and I really enjoy taking the kids 
                    here because no matter how old or young you are, there is something for you to see and experience. There so many wonderful exhibits displaying animals 
                    from all around the world. The exhibits are very informative and some of them are interactive, which is great for kids. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Probably the biggest highlight for my family is the animal programs (especially the dolphin and beluga whale programs). The animal programs
                    are a great opportuntiy to see the animals in action and to learn more about their species. The staff are well trained and knowledgeable. As well, 
                    it is very clear that they care about the animals and seek to provide the greatest care possible for the animals.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I highly recommend visiting the aquarium. The facilities are very nice and well kept. The exhibits are well designed and allow for up close viewing and
                    many exhibits have under water viewing areas (e.g. whales and dolphins). There are food services available inside the aquarium or you can bring your
                    own lunch and enjoy a picnic on the grass in Stanley Park.
                </p>
                <p> 
                    In addition to enjoying the experience of the aquarium, you get the 
                    added bonus of knowing the proceeds go to furthering research and supporting conservation
                    of the animals at the aquarium and in the wild. As well, the staff are very helpful and friendly and are often found near the exhibits available to 
                    provide interesting information about the animals and answer questions. Your time and money are well spent visiting this aquarium.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here is a list of my favorite programs (in order of preference):
                </p>

                        <li>Dolphin show</li>
                        <li>Beluga whale show</li>
                        <li>Penguin show</li>
                        </ol>
